# react-native-typescript-cheatsheet

This project aims to accumulate TypeScript advice for React Native users, in the same nature as https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet/. This is a new project and **we are actively seeking maintainers**. 

The goal is to **open source knowledge**:

- Write what you wish you had known
- What you will want to refer to in future
- Identify what you don't know and actively ask for community to fill in the gaps
- Be corrected on your misconceptions

An example list of sections:

- Setting up a RN + TS project from scratch
- Recommended Build tools + Prettifying/Linting setup
- Most commonly used RN APIs with their TS types
- Tips and tricks with RN Core's typings
- Tips and tricks with RN Community typings
